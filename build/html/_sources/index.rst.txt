Welcome to Triton-distributed's documentation!
==============================================

Triton-distributed is a distributed compiler designed for computation-communication overlapping, which is based on OpenAI Triton.

Using Triton-distributed, programmers are able to develop efficient kernels comparable to highly-optimized libraries (including `Distributed-GEMM <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/65_distributed_gemm>`_ and `FLUX <https://github.com/bytedance/flux/blob/main/README.md>`_). Triton-distributed currently mainly targets Nvidia GPU and AMD GPU. It can also be ported to other hardware platforms. Feel free to contact us if you want to use Triton-distributed on your own hardware.
